# Project Ekala

## Our Mission

Transform Nix into a modular, API-driven build system to enable scalable and extensible software deployment.

We will:

1. Implement a versioned, high-performance, and language-agnostic API
2. Create extensible client tools and libraries
3. Optimize caching and evaluation for large-scale environments
4. Make use of these tools and our philosophy to build a much more maintainable package set

Our efforts will preserve Nix's reproducibility while dramatically improving its maintainability and adaptability to diverse and evolving infrastructure needs.

## Key Projects

- [eos](https://github.com/ekala-project/eos): The build scheduler & gateway API binary
- [eka](https://github.com/ekala-project/eka): The CLI, defining the core logic for the Atom format, and offering a truly high-level interface into the store based world of Nix like tools.
- [atom](https://github.com/ekala-project/eka): The novel Nix module system that enables bounded, sensible evaluation for Nix code.
- [EEP](https://github.com/ekala-project/eeps): Ekala Enhancement Proposals
- [corepkgs](https://github.com/ekala-project/corepkgs): a minimal core of well maintain code, useful for maintaining a larger package set
- [stdenv](https://github.com/ekala-project/stdenv): the standard environment for Nix builds, abstracted to its own repository
- [ekapkgs roadmap](https://github.com/ekala-project/ekapkgs-roadmap): A road-map listing out the milestones and goals to get to our ultimate goal
