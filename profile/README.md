# Project Ekala

## Our Mission

To revolutionize store-based systems by creating a modern, user-friendly platform that combines innovative build scheduling, maintainable package management, and intelligent automation.

We will:

1. Pioneer the Atom format for reproducible, verifiable, and efficiently transferable package definitions
2. Develop a powerful, API-driven build scheduler that optimizes evaluation and caching
3. Create an intuitive CLI that makes store-based systems accessible and productive
4. Establish patterns and tools for maintaining large package sets through automation and static analysis
5. Build a modular ecosystem that enables seamless extension and adaptation

Our efforts preserve Nix's core strengths in reproducibility while dramatically improving:

- Developer experience through better tooling and APIs
- Package maintenance through automation and static guarantees
- System scalability through optimized scheduling and caching
- Code reuse through the Atom format and modular designs of ekapkgs
