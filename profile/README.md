# Project Ekala

## Our Mission

Transform Nix into a modular, API-driven build system to enable scalable and extensible software deployment.

We will:
1. Refactor Nix's monolithic architecture into discrete, interoperable components
2. Implement a versioned, high-performance, and language-agnostic API
3. Develop a daemon-based core for distributed operations
4. Create extensible client tools and libraries
5. Optimize caching and evaluation for large-scale environments

Our efforts will preserve Nix's reproducibility while dramatically improving its maintainability and adaptability to diverse and evolving infrastructure needs.

## Key Projects

- [eos](https://github.com/ekala-project/eos): The daemon
